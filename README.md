### Installation of CellRanger for rawdata alignment

Follow along this [link](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/installation) to install and setup cellranger pipeline.

#### Convert .bcl files to fastq
The cellranger `mkfastq` pipeline is a 10x-enhanced wrapper around Illumina bcl2fastq, which demultiplexes BCL files from a sequencer into FASTQs for analysis. For example, I will download a small `.bcl` file to show the functionality:

```bash
wget http://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/cellranger-tiny-bcl-1.2.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf cellranger-tiny-bcl-1.2.0.tar.gz
```
To run `mkfastq pipeline`, an Illumina Experiment Manager (IEM) sample sheet is also required. Note that his sample sheet is an example that is only valid for the `Single Cell 3â€² v2 chemistry`.  enter command below to download the data sheet.

```bash
wget http://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/cellranger-tiny-bcl-samplesheet-1.2.0.csv
```
The samplesheet looks like:
