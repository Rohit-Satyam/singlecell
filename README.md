### Installation of CellRanger for rawdata alignment

Follow along this [link](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/installation) to install and setup cellranger pipeline.

#### 1. Convert .bcl files to fastq
The cellranger `mkfastq` pipeline is a 10x-enhanced wrapper around Illumina bcl2fastq, which demultiplexes BCL files from a sequencer into FASTQs for analysis. For example, I will download a small `.bcl` file to show the functionality:

```bash
wget http://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/cellranger-tiny-bcl-1.2.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf cellranger-tiny-bcl-1.2.0.tar.gz
```
To run `mkfastq pipeline`, an Illumina Experiment Manager (IEM) sample sheet is also required. Note that his sample sheet is an example that is only valid for the `Single Cell 3â€² v2 chemistry`.  enter command below to download the data sheet.

```bash
wget http://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/cellranger-tiny-bcl-samplesheet-1.2.0.csv
```
The samplesheet looks like:

It is a sample sheet that in the `Illumina Experiment Manager (IEM)` format. Note that you can specify a 10x sample index set in the index column of the `Data` section. cellranger `mkfastq` also supports oligo sequences in the index column. In this example, only reads from `lane 1` will be used. To search for the given sample index across all lanes, omit the lanes column entirely. 

We run Cellranger to generate FASTQs. Option `--run` specifies path to the unzipped BCL file you want to demultiplex. Option `--samplesheet` specifies path sample sheet, `cellranger-tiny-bcl-samplesheet-1.2.0.csv` in this case.

```bash
## Install the bcl2fq first.This will be used to write fast files. Switch to this environment.

mamba create -n bcl2fq -c dranew bcl2fastq

## Also export the Path of cell ranger. To make it permanent, paste it in .bashrc and source
export PATH=/home/pichkari/rohit/tools/cellranger-6.0.1:$PATH
source ~/.bashrc

conda activate bcl2fastq
```

Running `mkfastq`

```bash
cellranger mkfastq --run=/home/pichkari/rohit/tools/cellranger-tiny-bcl-1.2.0 --samplesheet=/home/pichkari/rohit/tools/cellranger-tiny-bcl-samplesheet-1.2.0.csv
```
